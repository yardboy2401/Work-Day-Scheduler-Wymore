# Week 05 Homework Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Each hour of the workday planner should have a save button to save the text to local storage. Upon initial page load, if workday hour spots have text data in local storage, it should populate on the page for the correct hour of the workday. Checking against current time, previous hours in the workday should be background color of gray, current hour should be red, and future hours should be green background color.

## Languages Used

## Project Notes
Saving text for each workday hour to local storage is working as intended. Saves a Key in local storage of the hour of the workday for parsing data back to the page on initial page load if text is stored in local storage.
